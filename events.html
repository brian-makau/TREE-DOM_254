                <li class="heading">World Forestry Day- 21st March </li>
                <p class="pageCont">This event is held each year to help raise awareness of the importance of all types of forests. It
                    was
                    made by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012. On this day they encourage countries,
                    organisations
                    and individuals to to organise events involving trees. We at TREE-DOM 254 will not be hesitant to
                    involve
                    ourselves in this day. We plan to have an event to plant trees at various locations around the
                    country.
                </p>

                <li class="heading">World Environmental Day- 5th June</li>
                <p class="pageCont">Every year during this date, we will be doing a tree planting event to commemorate the event. The day
                    is
                    not necessarily set to celebrate trees specifically, but the environment. As we all know trees are a
                    huge
                    part of the environment and therefore, we would want to spread the message with such a platform.
                </p>

                <li class="heading">World Day to Combat Dessertification and Drought</li>
                <p class="pageCont">One of the leading most challenges against tree population is Dessertification. This is done by
                    people who cut
                    down huge volumes of trees and forests. We therefore, plan to have nation-wide events on these days
                    to educate
                    people on the dangers of dessertification and how trees are importaant to this cause.
                </p>

                <li class="heading">The Van Mahotsav Week- 1st-7th July</li>
                <p class="pageCont">Similar to the Indian festival Van Mahotsav("the festival of trees") we would like to hold a month
                    long event for
                    planting trees. The event would involve travelling around the country, especially the arid and
                    semi-arid areas
                    educating the masses and planting trees.

        <div class="comm_invol">
            <h2 class="heading">Community Involvement</h2>
            <p class="pageCont">At <strong>TREE-DOM 254</strong>,we are aware that the initiative we have cannot be achieved simply by trying to do this
                on our own. Community
                involvement is one of our key values. We want to involve our local community and the world-wide
                community as well in
                making sure that trees are planted all over the world.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading">These are some of the ways we have tried to do this:</h3>
            <ol class="pageCont">
                <li><strong class="p_heading">Annual Seminar</strong> - Each year year we plan to have a grand seminar, which would host
                    key environmentalists and
                    experts in the field of forestry in conjunction with the National Environment Management Authority
                    (<a href="https://www.nema.go.ke/">NEMA</a>) to educate nation-wide
                    representatives on what they need to know about trees. These representatives will then go forth and
                    spread the information to
                    others and engage them in tree planting activities.
                </li>

                <li class="heading">
                    <strong>Tree Planting Campaigns</strong> - We plan to have campaigns accross the country with our
                    counterparts NEMA and the national
                    government. The goal is to plant more than 2 million trees before the end of the year.
                </li>

                <li class="heading">
                    <strong>Campus Reach-Out Programmes</strong> - We have a department specially dedicated to reaching
                    out to university and college
                    students to recruit them to our cause. The goal is to create a nice platform for young people to
                    explore their options while
                    they do something great. WHAT BETTER CAUSE THAN HELPING SAVE MOTHER EARTH?
                </li>

                <li class="heading"><strong>Seedling Donations</strong> - This is an effort to help out those individuals or grous
                    that'd like to do their own tree planting
                    but do not have the resources to do so. We donate seedlings to the latter and to schools too so that
                    they can do it on their own.
