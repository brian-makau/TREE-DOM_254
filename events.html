            <h2>Important Dates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>World Forestry Day- 21st March </li>
                <p>This event is held each year to help raise awareness of the importance of all types of forests. It was 
                    made by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012. On this day they encourage countries, organisations 
                    and individuals to to organise events involving trees. We at TREE-DOM 254 will not be hesitant to involve 
                    ourselves in this day. We plan to have an event to plant trees at various locations around the country.
                </p>

                <li>World Environmental Day- 5th June</li>
                <p>Every year during this date, we will be doing a tree planting event to commemorate the event. The day is 
                    not necessarily set to celebrate trees specifically, but the environment. As we all know trees are a huge 
                    part of the environment and therefore, we would want to spread the message with such a platform.
                </p>

                <li>World Day to Combat Dessertification and Drought</li>
                <p>One of the leading most challenges against tree population is Dessertification. This is done by people who cut 
                    down huge volumes of trees and forests. We therefore, plan to have nation-wide events on these days to educate
                    people on the dangers of dessertification and how trees are importaant to this cause.
                </p>

                <li>The Van Mahotsav Week- 1st-7th July</li>
                <p>Similar to the Indian festival Van Mahotsav("the festival of trees") we would like to hold a month long event for 
                    planting trees. The event would involve travelling around the country, especially the arid and semi-arid areas 
                    educating the masses and planting trees.

            <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
            <p>At TREE-DOM 254,we are aware that the initiative we have cannot be achieved simply by trying to do this on our own. Community
               involvement is one of our key values. We want to involve our local community and the world-wide community as well in 
               making sure that trees are planted all over the world.
            </p>

            <h3>These are some of the ways we have tried to do this:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Annual Seminar</strong> - Each year year we plan to have a grand seminar, which would host key environmentalists and 
                    experts in the field of forestry in conjunction with the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) to educate nation-wide 
                    representatives on what they need to know about trees. These representatives will then go forth and spread the information to 
                    others and engage them in tree planting activities.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Tree Planting Campaigns</strong> - We plan to have campaigns accross the country with our counterparts NEMA and the national 
                    government. The goal is to plant more than 2 million trees before the end of the year.  
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Campus Reach-Out Programmes</strong> - We have a department specially dedicated to reaching out to university and college 
                    students to recruit them to our cause. The goal is to create a nice platform for young people to explore their options while
                    they do something great. WHAT BETTER CAUSE THAN HELPING SAVE MOTHER EARTH?
                </li>

                <li><strong>Seedling Donations</strong> - This is an effort to help out those individuals or grous that'd like to do their own tree planting
                    but do not have the resources to do so. We donate seedlings to the latter and to schools too so that they can do it on their own.
