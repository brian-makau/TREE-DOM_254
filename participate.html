            <p>Fighting Climate Change may seem out of reach for individuals or small companies. However, at TREE-DOM_254, we make it easy for everybody to get involved in environmental conservation.
            The <strong>Earth</strong> is what we all have in common, and it is everybody's responsibility to keep it habitable, having the future generations in mind.<p>We have a volunteering program, where registered members take part in tree planting activities. Volunteers also take part in online campaigns that include protecting our trees. Each volunteer gets an e-certificate to verify membership. <br><button class="open-button" onclick="openForm ()" class="button">Volunteer</button></p>
